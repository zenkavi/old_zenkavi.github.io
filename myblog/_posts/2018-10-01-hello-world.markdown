This might become my new blog if I suddenly start writing one.

Regardless, welcome to my new social media outlet where I plan to host mostly professional information.

At least it looks pretty.

Note: The URL for this website is determined by the front matter to have the format /:categories/:year/:month/:day/:title. This can be changed by adding a permalink variable to the front matter. With a permalink the site would not break if any of the variables in the default format of the URL are changed (e.g. date)
