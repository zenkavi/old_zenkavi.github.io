## My Story

At 25 I had a cancer scare. I was so mortified when I heard the word "tumor" that I haven't been able to touch a cigarette since. I realized how badly I wanted to live and how little I was doing for that. So I changed my lifestyle completely and started treating my body better. As I started feeling better about my body I wanted to challenge and test it further. I needed some sort of validation that this extraordinary, unnecessary and certainly unwanted tissue inside of me was not going to take away anything from me. So I started racing.

My first race was a [Spartan Sprint](https://www.spartan.com/en/race/detail/3926/overview) (5 miles), an obstacle course where one jumps over walls and fires, climbs ropes, flips tires and the sorts. Mostly I was covered in mud. A lot of it. But it was exhilarating and there was no going back. After that I did a [Spartan Super](https://www.spartan.com/en/race/detail/4236/overview) (8 miles), the [San Francisco Half Marathon](http://www.thesfmarathon.com/) (twice), a [Terrain Race](http://terrainrace.com/) and eventually the [Spartan Beast](https://www.spartan.com/en/race/detail/3690/overview) (16 miles) at the World Championships in Tahoe.

Having rolled around in my fair share of mud I started doing triathlons. My first race was the olympic distance at [Tri Santa Cruz](http://www.finishlineproduction.com/events/triathlon/TriSantaCruz/TriSantaCruz.html) (1.5 km swim, 27 mile bike, 10k run). A month later I did the [Half Ironman in Santa Cruz](http://www.ironman.com/triathlon/events/americas/ironman-70.3/santa-cruz.aspx) (1.2 mile swim, 56 mile bike, 13.1 mile run). Once again I was hooked.  

I'm sure there is a joke somewhere about studying self-control and self-experimenting.

This year I decided I was strong enough to swim, bike, run without failing for something much bigger than me. But this time I need your help in raising the funds to participate. Both causes are very dear to my heart from having close friends who deal with them.
