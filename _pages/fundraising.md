A couple years ago I had a health scare. After that I changed my lifestyle and became more active. Soon after I found myself rolling in mud at obstacle course races as I have a habit of testing the boundaries of things. I'm sure there is a joke somewhere about studying self-control and self-experimenting.

As I am finishing up one decade on this planet and starting a new one I decided to combine this newfound passion with something much  bigger than me: Racing for charity. Give me a birthday gift by donating to the causes below and/or by sharing this page.
