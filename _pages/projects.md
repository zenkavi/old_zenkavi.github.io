## Self-regulation

### Ontological structure of the space

Psychology is rich with related constructs on self-regulation (e.g. impulsivity, self-control, inhibition etc.) and even richer in behavioral tasks and surveys to measure these putative constructs. It does lack, however, a clear understanding of how these constructs and the measures relate to each other. As part of the [Science of Behavior Change](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_description.cfm?projectnumber=1UH2DA041713-01) initiative we addressed this question by running a large battery (35 tasks, 23 surveys) on a large sample (n=552). You can find our tantalizing results in our [preprint](https://psyarxiv.com/fvqej/).

### Trait measures of self-regulation measures

Tasked with finding the best 'behavioral assays' of self-regulation we examined the stability of all the measures from our large battery of tasks and surveys. We followed up with 150 of our participants who completed our battery and asked them to complete it a second time 2-4 months after their initial completion. Additionally we completed a detailed analysis of the literature on the retest reliability of all our measures for comparability with our dataset. We found that the literature was noisy to begin with and that the survey measures were more reliable than task measures. We report our findings in our [preprint](https://psyarxiv.com/x5pm4).

## Tools for reproducible science

### Experiment Factory

Experiment Factory is an "an open source framework for the development and deployment of web-based experiments." [Sochat et al., 2016][https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00610/full]. We developed this platform to run our large scale multiwave online experiments. It consists of a Python application and a repository of behavioral experiments and surveys coded in javascript using jsPsych (de Leeuw, 2015)[https://link-springer-com.stanford.idm.oclc.org/article/10.3758/s13428-014-0458-y]. As we hoped for it has been used by other researchers for their experiments as well (e.g. [Klaus and Schutter, 2017](https://www-sciencedirect-com.stanford.idm.oclc.org/science/article/pii/S0306452218301751))
