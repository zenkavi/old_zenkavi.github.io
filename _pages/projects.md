## Self-regulation

### Ontological structure of the space

Psychology is rich with related constructs on self-regulation (e.g. impulsivity, self-control, inhibition etc.) and even richer in behavioral tasks and surveys to measure these putative constructs. It does lack, however, a clear understanding of how these constructs and the measures relate to each other. As part of the [Science of Behavior Change](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_description.cfm?projectnumber=1UH2DA041713-01) initiative we addressed this question by running a large battery (35 tasks, 23 surveys) on a large sample (n=552). You can find our tantalizing results in our [preprint](https://psyarxiv.com/fvqej/).

### Trait measures of self-regulation measures

Tasked with finding the best 'behavioral assays' of self-regulation we 

we followed up with 150 of our participants who completed our battery and asked them to

In a more detailed analysis of this dataset we compared raw measures to model parameters as trait measures.

## Tools for reproducible science

### Experiment Factory

Experiment Factory is an "an open source framework for the development and deployment of web-based experiments." [Sochat et al., 2016][https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00610/full]. We developed this platform to run our large scale multiwave online experiments. It consists of a Python application and a repository of behavioral experiments and surveys coded in javascript using jsPsych (de Leeuw, 2015)[https://link-springer-com.stanford.idm.oclc.org/article/10.3758/s13428-014-0458-y]. As we hoped for it has been used by other researchers for their experiments as well (e.g. [Klaus and Schutter, 2017](https://www-sciencedirect-com.stanford.idm.oclc.org/science/article/pii/S0306452218301751))
