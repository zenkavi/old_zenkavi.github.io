I am a postdoctoral scholar at Caltech working with [Antonio Rangel](http://www.hss.caltech.edu/people/antonio-rangel). I received my graduate degree from Stanford University where I worked with [Russell Poldrack](https://poldracklab.stanford.edu/). I study the neural correlates of decision-making, particularly decisions that involve self-regulation, and the psychometric properties of measures in this field.
