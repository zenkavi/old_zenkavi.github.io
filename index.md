I am a graduate student in the Psychology Department of Stanford University working with [Russell Poldrack](https://poldracklab.stanford.edu/). I study the neural correlates of decision-making, particularly decisions that involve self-regulation, and the psychometric properties of measures in this field. Soon I hope to build tools that will enable researchers conduct reproducible meta-analyses in behavioral sciences.
